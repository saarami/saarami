## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🥗 Protein Calorie Tracker – Backend REST API
**Main project**

A smart and simple nutrition tracker that allows users to enter free-text meals and instantly receive calorie and protein insights, track daily goals, and monitor long-term progress — implemented as a production-ready backend system built with a layered architecture and deployed on AWS.

**Highlights**
- Layered architecture: Routers → Services → Repositories → Models
- JWT authentication & authorization
- Redis caching + token-bucket rate limiting
- Telegram webhook integration
- Dockerized & deployed on AWS EC2 using Terraform
- CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- PostgreSQL as primary database

### ⚡ Bitaxe Monitor – Home Bitcoin Miner Backend
Backend system for monitoring a **home Bitcoin miner (Bitaxe Gamma 601)**, built as a personal project that started from a hobby and evolved into a full backend system.

The project was designed to make Bitcoin mining **accessible and understandable** for people without deep technical or mining knowledge.

**Highlights**
- REST API built with Python & FastAPI
- Scheduled data collection from the miner (telemetry & status)
- Real-time alerts and notifications (Telegram)
- PostgreSQL for persistent storage
- Docker-based deployment
- Simple React + Vite dashboard for visualization and monitoring

## 🧱 Architecture Principles

- **Routers** – HTTP layer, request/response schemas, orchestration
- **Schemas (Pydantic)** – API contracts and validation
- **Services** – business logic and workflows
- **Repositories** – persistence layer and database access
- **Models** – SQLAlchemy ORM entities
- **Infrastructure** – Redis, PostgreSQL, Docker, AWS

## 🛠 Tech Stack

**Backend**
- Python 3.11, FastAPI
- SQLAlchemy, Pydantic
- JWT authentication

**Data**
- PostgreSQL
- Redis (cache & rate limiting)

**DevOps / Cloud**
- Docker & Docker Compose
- Terraform
- AWS EC2
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD)

**Integrations**
